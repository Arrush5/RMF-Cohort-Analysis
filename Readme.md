## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:
- Perform customer segmentation using **RFM analysis**
- Track customer retention over time using **cohort analysis**
- Visualize trends in customer behavior
- Identify high-value customers and churn risk segments
- Support data-driven decisions for marketing and retention strategies

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) helps segment customers based on how recently and frequently they purchase and how much they spend. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
